  <p>
  	Beanstalkd is a big to-do list for your distributed application. If there is a unit of work that you want to defer to later (say, sending an email, pushing some data to a slow external service, pulling data from a slow external service, generating high-quality image thumbnails) you put a description of that work, a "job", into beanstalkd. Some processes (such as web request handlers), "producers", put jobs into the queue. Other processes, "workers", take jobs out of the queue and run them.
